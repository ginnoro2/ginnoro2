	version control manager has two tier architecture:
	
	V1--running > server > clients are using it 
	cannot be disturbed. so need to make another working to keep the changes 
	which is different than the main copy called 
	
	-- repository	>>first tier
	--working copy ?? >>second tier
		restore
		discard changes
		add modifications
		and so on 

	V2-->>maintainance , bug fixing, feature adding, wearable integration 
 	
	diff -> difference between object

	GIT has three tier architecture:
	-- working directory
	-- staging index
	-- repo
		LEVLES : ( puts file in 3 version ) 
	working directory ->> make changes 
	staging ->> staged ( to make it ready to commit ) 
	repo->> commit
	
	<<<- increaases the number of copies
	number of tracks increased ->>> 
	
	
	levels ->> here working is from  
	system development 
	
9. basic git commands
	man git config

Programming ? Compiler? Source code?
converts source code to machine language.
